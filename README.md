# Prediction-of-Stock-closing-price

Ridge regression is a technique that is used for assessing the coefficients of
multiple regression models. This technique is used in scenarios where linearly
independent variables are highly correlated hence it is perfect to be used with
the dataset of stocks. We can use this model to predict the closing price of
stocks. 
Using this model, we have gained an __accuracy of 99%__ and our __mean error values are close to zero__.
